# pitchshifter
pitch shift custom modfx using ring buffer for the korg NTS-1 logue sdk

based off of the vibrato by Oleg Burdaev https://github.com/dukesrg/logue-fx, but modified to work as a modfx and vibrato element removed.
I added a LPF to try and control some of the digital noise - doesn't really work!

knob A controls depth (-12 to +12 semitones)
knob B controls a low pass filter
